## Overview

*Bang!* is currently an experimental 3D environment. The project emphasizes foundational development, starting with world building and movement mechanics.

### Features in Progress

- First-person player movement  
- Basic physics and collision handling  
- Empty world for testing and iterative adjustments

### Planned Features

- Shooting mechanics  
- Enemy AI  
- Interactive objects and expanded environments

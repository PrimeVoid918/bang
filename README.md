Currently, *Bang!* is an experimental 3D world. The project focuses on building the environment and movement mechanics first.

**Features (in progress):**  

- First-person movement  
- Basic colliders and world physics  
- Empty world for testing and adjustments

**Planned Features:**  

- Shooting mechanics  
- Enemy AI  
- Interactive objects and map expansion

## Technologies Used

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) – 3D rendering and scene management  
- [Rapier.js](https://rapier.rs/) – Physics engine for collision detection and movement  
- TypeScript – For type-safe development  
- Vite – Build tool and development server
